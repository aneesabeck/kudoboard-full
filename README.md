### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics helped a lot to prepare me, especially the labs! It allowed me to have better expectations of what the project would be like. Specifically, lab 3 and 4 helped me with understanding how to filter and search for the boards. However, I felt 
slightly unprepared in using schema but it was interesting to navigate on my own

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would've used less components in my project. Nearing the end of my project, I realized that some of the code could have been used in one component. I think this would've made it easier for me to navigate files in the project.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

In my project demo, everything in my project looked very neat and presentable. However, I noticed that some of my features would only show up if I reload on my page. So next time, I would definitely present my rendered website rather instead because it would load more quickly.
